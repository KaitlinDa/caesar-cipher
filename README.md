## About
This project implements the classic Caesar cipher, a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. It includes functions for encrypting and decrypting messages, as well as a crack function that attempts to decrypt messages without knowing the shift key, leveraging the NLTK corpus to identify English words. Designed for educational purposes, it demonstrates basic principles of cryptography and text processing in Python.
